            Hello! I am <b>Yuvaraj Vanjari</b>, a dedicated software engineer with a strong interest in
            web development. <br>
            <FONT Size=4FACE="TimesNewRoman" COLOR="black">My name is Darshan G , I am currently pursuing my studies in
                CSBS, with a strong interest in programming and algorithmic problem-solving. <br> I enjoy working with
                python language, especially on graph algorithms and simulations. <br> My short-term goal is to become a
                Front-end Developer. <br>I am a task-oriented learner who values clarity and persistence, and I always
                try to connect theory with practical applications.</FONT>
        </P>
        <P align="center">
            <FONT size=4FACE="TimesNewRoman" COLOR="black">Beyond academics, I am passionate about applying theoretical
                concepts to real-world scenarios. <br>I enjoy tackling challenging problems, because they allow me to
                combine logical reasoning with creativity. <br>I see myself as a persistent learner who values clarity
                and structure, and I believe that consistent practice and curiosity are the keys to mastering complex
                subjects. <br> My long-term aspiration is to use my technical skills to contribute to innovative
                projects that solve practical problems and make a meaningful impact.</FONT>
